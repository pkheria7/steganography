# Steganography Project

## Overview
This project explores various methods of hiding information within images, utilizing techniques from basic image manipulation to more complex graph-based methods. The journey began with foundational concepts and evolved into a sophisticated implementation that reflects the project's goals.

## Development Journey

1. **BaseModel**
   - In this initial phase, I learned how to store information within an image. This foundational understanding set the stage for more advanced techniques.

2. **Left_Right**
   - Building on the knowledge from BaseModel, I developed the `Left_Right` module. This allowed for greater control over how pixel values are manipulated, enhancing the ability to hide messages within images.

3. **Just_Graph**
   - To deepen my understanding of data structures, I created the `Just_Graph` module. This module introduced graph concepts, which are crucial for navigating and manipulating pixel data in a more structured way.

4. **Text_In_Image**
   - The `text_in_image` module combines the graph concepts with bit manipulation techniques. This integration allows for more efficient encoding and decoding of messages hidden within images.

5. **FixLength and VariableLength**
   - These modules were developed to handle different message lengths effectively. They ensure that the hidden messages can be stored and retrieved accurately, regardless of their size.

6. **Hide_Next_Point**
   - The culmination of my efforts is the `hide_next_point` module. This module encapsulates the project's vision, showcasing a comprehensive approach to steganography that reflects the lessons learned throughout the development process.

## Conclusion
This project represents a significant learning experience in the field of steganography. From basic image manipulation to advanced graph-based methods, each module contributes to a deeper understanding of how information can be concealed within digital images. I look forward to further enhancing this project and exploring new techniques in the future.
